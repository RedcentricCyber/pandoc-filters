# Redcentric's Pandoc Filters

This repository represents a number of [Pandoc
Filters](https://pandoc.org/lua-filters.html) that can be used to generate
documentation. These filters allow for files written in Markdown, too be
converted into \LaTeX using Pandoc, which can  then be used to produce a PDF.
